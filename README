Clone repository and install dependencies
You will need to clone the source code of angular2-material-admin GitHub repository:

git clone https://github.com/bhbhken/angular2-material-admin.git
After the repository is cloned, go inside of the repository directory and install dependencies:

cd angular2-material-admin
npm install
This will setup a working copy of ng2-admin on your local machine.

Running local copy
To run a local copy in development mode, execute:

npm start
Go to http://0.0.0.0:3000 or http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

To run the local copy in production mode and build the sources, execute:

npm run prebuild:prod && npm run build:prod && npm run server:prod
This will clear up your dist folder (where release files are located), generate a release build and start the built-in server. Now you can copy the sources from the dist folder and use it with any backend framework or simply put it under a web server.
